<h1>Biography</h1>
      <div id="Biography" class="Biography">
        My name is Noibi Wahab Abiodun, the first child in my family, residing
        in Lagos, Nigeria. I pursued a National Diploma in Business
        Administration and Management at Lagos State Polytechnic, followed by a
        Higher National Diploma in the same field at Kwara State Polytechnic.
        These academic experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in
        business principles and management strategies. Beyond my formal
        education, I have accumulated three years of hands-on computer training
        experience. I approached each task with determination and a
        solution-oriented mindset. My colleagues and mentors often commend my
        ability to dissect complex problems and devise effective solutions. This
        aptitude has not only enhanced my technical skills but also instilled in
        me a profound appreciation for continuous learning and adaptation in the
        ever-evolving tech landscape. In addition to my technical endeavors, I
        am a passionate fashion designer. This creative pursuit allows me to
        channel my imagination into tangible designs, blending aesthetics with
        functionality. Fashion design has taught me the importance of
        innovation, attention to detail, and the courage to experiment qualities
        that are equally valuable in software development. I firmly believe that
        my creative background provides me with a unique perspective, enabling
        me to approach technological challenges with originality and an open
        mind.
